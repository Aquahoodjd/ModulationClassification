# Modulation Classification

## Problem statement
  A synthetic dataset, generated with GNU Radio, consisting of 11 modulations.
  This is a variable-SNR dataset with moderate LO drift, light fading, and numerous
  different labeled SNR increments for use in measuring performance across
  different signal and noise power scenarios. It is required to train and compare
  three different models then try to combine and modify these architectures to
  obtain better results
